>> This is my first Android Studio project, i made a final code review now that i finished the course, but i left the code exactly how i did, so could be done  make a analisys about my learning process. <br> Also i left a video of the application presented by the professor, so could be made a comparison about what was supposed to be done, and what i presented. As you'll see throughout the apps i've created, i don't like to just copy and paste what the professor was asking, everytime he showed something to do, i would stop the video and start making the code with my own thoughts and solve every problem by my own.
