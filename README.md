### MY ORGANIZZE APP PROJECT FOR CLASS<br />
This is my first Android Studio project, i made a final code review now that i finished the course, but i left the code exactly how i did,
so i can  make a analisys about my learning process. <br />
Also i left a video of the application presented by the professor, so you could make a comparison about what was supposed to be done,
and what i presented. As you'll see throughout the apps i've created, i don't like to just copy and paste what the professor was asking, 
everytime he showed something to make i would stop the video and start making the code with my own thoughts and solve every problem by own.
